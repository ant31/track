## track - automatic time tracker for computer work

Track logs your desktop active time and the applications you're using to 
create a time chart of your working day.

In comparison to  [KTimeTracker](https://www.kde.org/applications/utilities/ktimetracker/) 
or [Hamster](or https://projecthamster.wordpress.com/about/) Track goes with
as little user interaction as possible. Once configured you just (auto)start it
and Track runs on it's own.

The current project state is very early. Very basic features are still missing
so it might be wise to come back in a week or so. However it's save to use the
tool and it's providing some interesting information already.


### requirements

* Linux (Windows coming soon)
* Python 2.7 (Python 3 coming soon)
* PyQt4
* python-libwnck


### how to run

Just clone the repository and run `track.py`.
